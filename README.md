# Nicks Plate

Welcome to Nicks Plate. This is a prototype of a hip restaurant that hopefully will engage both employees and the customers. 
I feel that the web is crowded with both clicks here and information there. So much that It sometimes feels misleading. 
Information on this website for the customer is about 

- __Chef Today's Dish__

- __Staff Input__

- __Enviroment Input__

- __Policy__

## Features 

The welcoming front hopefully gives the customer a feeling that the water moves but is calm. 
Beneath the front is a short briefing of the soul of the restaurant, there is also a schedule that can 
be seen if you sign in. 


### Extra Features

The website is built in Django and from *the Djangos Admin page* employees can upload new information to the website. 
Image information and text will be saved in separate servers.
